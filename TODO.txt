        DB settings dump and size control

    Usability:
        review docstrings and ussage hints
        review settings and deployment cogs, they kinda suck

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Test and deploy

    Stats:
        Refactor for speed (tons of calculations being done multiple times, not good)
        Something so that VC Mins are counted properly (rn if session longer than an hour, it missrepresents) (truncate hourly buckets to 60 min)
        Rethink Visualizations, maybe more compact would be nicer
        Embed for server wide, analyze server peak times and dead times?

        !inactive @role <ndays> <threshold>
        !host_candidates <ndays> <top x>


    ReactionRoles:
        make a message a rr message manually


    Logging:

        !add_reason could be more user friendly (maybe react/prompt)

        search event by event in api and cover every fucking reported event
            think more stuff to log (check api)


    Moderation:
        server mute ask for reason,?
        people get self unmuted when no reason is added?

    Events
        event mode (mute people for the first 10 mins?)
        move people from one vc to another command

    Testing
    CI/CD
