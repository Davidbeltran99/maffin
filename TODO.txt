Add features






    Dev Ops:
        Dockerize
        Git Pull
        DB Dump and size control

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Test and deploy

    Stats:
        Refactor for speed (tons of calculations being done multiple times, not good)
        Something so that VC Mins are counted properly (rn if session longer than an hour, it missrepresents) (truncate hourly buckets to 60 min)
        Rethink Visualizations, maybe more compact would be nicer
        Embed for server wide, analyze server peak times and dead times?


    ReactionRoles:
        make a message a rr message manually


    Logging:
        search event by event in api and cover every fucking reported event
            useful utilities
                important_perms
                make embed with moderator field
                ez way to add perms to embed

                add_channel to embed
                add role to embed
                add user to embed
                add message to embed


    Analytics:
        !inactive @role <ndays> <threshold>
        !host_candidates <ndays> <top x>

    Logging
        !add_reason could be more user friendly (maybe react/prompt)

    Moderation:
    server mute ask for reason,?
    people get self unmuted when no reason is added?

    Events
        event mode (mute people for the first 10 mins?)
        move people from one vc to another command

    Usability:
        review docstrings and ussage hints
        review settings and deployment cogs, they kinda suck



DevOps:

    Testing
    CI/CD

        incremental game, with voice chat time / messages (starts at zero)

    Shop:

            !moneyx combos/flat rates/less cd
            %bonus on random pickups/chance of doubling
            item that gives points per chat message/voice mins (many tiers, can be stacked)
