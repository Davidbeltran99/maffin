        might be able to improve code quality
    Moderation
        Add kick/ban with reason and good interaction with logs
    ReactionRoles
        Probably needs major refactor/rework (hide channel to avoid pinging people)
        Make sure that messages that no longer exist get cleaned from db

                        minutes in voice chat
                        pie chart of channels? (al pe2)

                    Find inactive <hosts/staff> <n> <y>
                        set n number of days
                        find users who spent less than y * 10 mins/ sent less than y messages in the period

                    Find most active non host/staff in the last n days

                server wide:

                    Find periods of high activity (best time for events)
                    Find periods where the server is dead
                    Find periods when there is no mods/hosts
                    View individual channel activity

         Data Points:
            Member send message [user_id,channel_id,time,message_lenght]
            Member joins vc [user_id,channel_id,time]
            Member moves vc [user_id,old_channel_id,new_channel_id,time] //might be modeled as a leave and a join
            Member leaves vc [user_id,channel_id,time]
