    ReactionRoles Almost Done
        No le creo NADA
        problems with auto update:
            remove reactions and remove role if they already have it, no need to stack reactions
            a category might be deleted or created on update
        while updating, it might ping people, not cool (manual update with -f flag? rip auto)

    Analytics
        Complete rework

                        minutes in voice chat
                        pie chart of channels? (al pe2)

                    Find inactive <hosts/staff> <n> <y>
                        set n number of days
                        find users who spent less than y * 10 mins/ sent less than y messages in the period

                    Find most active non host/staff in the last n days

                server wide:

                    Find periods of high activity (best time for events)
                    Find periods where the server is dead
                    Find periods when there is no mods/hosts
                    View individual channel activity

         Data Points:
            Member send message [user_id,channel_id,time,message_lenght]
            Member joins vc [user_id,channel_id,time]
            Member moves vc [user_id,old_channel_id,new_channel_id,time] //might be modeled as a leave and a join
            Member leaves vc [user_id,channel_id,time]
